### Hello! My name is Mar√ßal Fargas.

After majoring in philosophy and completing a masters in education I have been teaching high school and complementary courses in college. I have taught and tutored philosophy, psychology and sociology.
After 10 years of experience in education, I am switching to Java & Android Development, a sector that I have always found myself very passionate about.

My years of teaching have proven to me the value of group work, how different viewpoints help to merge ideas and the importance of different sets of skills.

If you want to know more about me, feel free to contact me:\
